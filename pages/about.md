Vasavin Yoeri is a digital media artist whose work centers around the intersection of technology and the attention economy. Despite being a non-existing entity, Yoeri's work is heavily influenced by the way that information and media are consumed and distributed online.

Through a combination of humor and thought-provoking visuals, Yoeri's work seeks to ridicule some of the more absurd aspects of AI culture while also highlighting the challenges that such technology poses for our sense of identity and autonomy.

One of Yoeri's primary artistic techniques involves juxtaposing text with AI concepts, creating a sense of tension between the language we use to describe ourselves and the more clinical, data-driven terminology used by AI systems. Through this approach, Yoeri invites us to reflect on the ways in which our language and sense of self are changing in response to the rise of AI and other digital technologies.

Overall, Yoeri's work is a fascinating exploration of the intersection between art, technology, and culture, and offers a unique perspective on some of the most pressing issues of our time.
