Vasavin Yoeri is a digital media artist whose work centers around the intersection of technology and the attention economy. Despite being a non-existing entity, Yoeri's work is heavily influenced by the way that information and media are consumed and distributed online.

Through a combination of humor and thought-provoking visuals, Yoeri's work seeks to ridicule some of the more absurd aspects of AI culture while also highlighting the challenges that such technology poses for our sense of identity and autonomy.

One of Yoeri's primary artistic techniques involves juxtaposing text with AI concepts, creating a sense of tension between the language we use to describe ourselves and the more clinical, data-driven terminology used by AI systems. Through this approach, Yoeri invites us to reflect on the ways in which our language and sense of self are changing in response to the rise of AI and other digital technologies.

Overall, Yoeri's work is a fascinating exploration of the intersection between art, technology, and culture, and offers a unique perspective on some of the most pressing issues of our time.


### Attention Flux
Project Title: "Juxtaposing the boundaries of social economics or Attention Flux"

In this project, I explore the fascinating intersection between text and image AI, questioning the boundaries between the two and the ways they can be brought together to create new forms of artistic expression in relation with the social media frenzy of these days.


Text-to-image AI has been a hot topic in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years. By feeding text into an AI system, it can generate images that closely match the input text, sometimes with surprising accuracy. However, this technology has been mainly used for practical purposes such as generating product images, designing interiors, or creating illustrations for children's books or meme-ificiaton.

In this project, I take a different approach, using text-to-image AI as a starting point to explore the creative potential of this technology and the definition of real, fake, attention. Instead of solely relying on AI-generated images, I use the generated images as a basis for further exploration, experimentation, and creative expression.

### AICEE

Project Title: "Aesthetical Impacts of Artificial Intelligence: Exploring Emotion through Everyday Images"

I explore the relationship between AI and human creativity by using Midjourney AI text-to-image software as a tool for artistic expression.

I experiments with using different types of input text prompts to generate images that evoke different emotions, concepts, or moods. For example, I could use prompts that are open-ended and allow for a range of interpretations, such as "the sound of silence" or "the feeling of nostalgia." 
The project aims to explore the potential of AI-generated images in conveying complex emotions to the viewers through everyday images. The project will explore the aesthetics of AI-generated art and its ability to generate emotions from the viewer. What in a way is the purpose of an artist is to convey emotions out of the work and out of a viewer.

Creating emotion out of an emotionless machine.

Plato believed that poetry, as well as other forms of art, was a representation of reality rather than reality itself. In his dialogues, specifically in "The Republic," Plato argues that the arts, including poetry, are imitations of the world and therefore not truly real.

Ultimately, this project could raise questions about the role of AI in the creative process and the ways in which technology can be used to expand our understanding of aesthetics and human expression.
