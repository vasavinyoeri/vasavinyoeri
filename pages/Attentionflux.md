I am a digital media artist whose work centers around the intersection of technology and the phenomena of the attention economy. My work is heavily influenced by the way that information and media are consumed and distributed online.

Using text-to-AI tools, I create artworks that challenge the viewer's perception of reality and their relationship to technology. Through this process, I explore how technology shapes our identities and how we interact with the world around us.

In this project, I explore the fascinating intersection between text and image AI, questioning the boundaries between the two and the ways they can be brought together to create new forms of artistic expression in relation with the social media frenzy of these days.


Text-to-image AI has been a hot topic in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years. By feeding text into an AI system, it can generate images that closely match the input text, sometimes with surprising accuracy. However, this technology has been mainly used for practical purposes such as generating product images, designing interiors, or creating illustrations for children's books or meme-ificiaton.

In this project, I take a different approach, using text-to-image AI as a starting point to explore the creative potential of this technology and the definition of real, fake, attention. Instead of solely relying on AI-generated images, I use the generated images as a basis for further exploration, experimentation, and creative expression.
